# Approach --- 
For this project we follow the suggested implementation strategy from the assignment page. 
- In level 1, we have a window of 2 by using a loop of 2 range. This will send 2 packet at a time.
- In level 2, we added the sequence number to the msg json as a field. Both send and recv increment the sequence number and recv will only send ack back when the number    matches. 
- In level 3, we implemented window on the receiver side as an array. The receiver will store it and send the corresponding ack back in order. 
- In level 4, we added timestamp and retransmitted field to the json message. The program will retransmit messages that had exceeded 1 sec since it was sent. The -         retransmitted field will also be true which will let the receiver side know to send ack for it. 
-In level 5, we made sure that the program will drop a packet if 
  1) Json had trouble loading or invalid
  2) The fields are incorrect 
  3) The compression of the data is inconsistent after sending by implementing a checksum field. This field stores encoded data using zlib.
- In level 6, we changed the retransmission timeout from 1 second to 2 x RTT. The estimated RTT equals the time of the most recently received ACK subtracted by the         corresponding packetâ€™s sent time. If retransmission have to be done, the sender return to slow start.
- In level 7, for a faster program we implemented RENO fast retransmit. When the sender side receives a ack it will store its sequence number in an received_ack array.
  It'll then check if receiver send this ack's sequence number appeared 3 or more time in the array. 
 
# Challenges --- 
- We struggled to think of a way to measure the time since a packet had been sent.
- For level 4 the program was timing out due to excessive retransmission
- The program was often too slow, resulting in time exceeded 

# Design and features --- 

# Testing --- 
For testing, we use the test file in the configs folder. We would run the implementation with the relevant configs test after each step.
